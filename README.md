# Python Cheat Sheet

Description: List of Python Commands

## 1) B A S I C S

### Print
Prints a string into the console.
```
print("Hello World")
```
### Input
Prints a string into the console,
and asks the user for a string input.
```
input("What's your name")
```
### Comments
Adding a # symbol in font of text
lets you make comments on a line of code.
The computer will ignore your comments.
```
#This is a comment
print("This is code")
```
### Variables
A variable give a name to a piece of data.
Like a box with a label, it tells you what's
inside the box.
```
my_name = "Angela"
my_age = 12
```
### The += Operator
This is a convient way of saying: "take the
previous value and add to it.
```
my_age = 12
my_age += 4
#my_age is now 16
```
## 2) D A T A T Y P E S
### Integers
Integers are whole numbers.
```
my_number = 354
```
### Floating Point Numbers
Floats are numbers with decimal places.
When you do a calculation that results in
a fraction e.g. 4 รท 3 the result will always be
a floating point number.
```
my_float = 3.14159
```
### Strings
A string is just a string of characters.
It should be surrounded by double quotes.
```
my_string = "Hello"
```
### String Concatenation
You can add strings to string to create
a new string. This is called concatenation.
It results in a new string.
```
"Hello" + "Angela"
#becomes "HelloAngela"
```
### Escaping a String
Because the double quote is special, it
denotes a string, if you want to use it in
a string, you need to escape it with a "\"
```
speech = "She said: \"Hi\""
print(speech)
#prints: She said: "Hi"
```
### F-Strings
You can insert a variable into a string
using f-strings.
The syntax is simple, just insert the variable
in-between a set of curly braces {}.
```
days = 365
print(f"There are {days} in a year")
```
### Converting Data Types
You can convert a variable from 1 data
type to another.
Converting to float:
float()
Converting to int:
int()
Converting to string:
str()
```
n = 354
new_n = float(n)
print(new_n) #result 354.0
```
### Checking Data Types

## 3) M A T H S
### Arithmetic Operators
You can do mathematical calculations with
Python as long as you know the right
operators.
```
3+2 #Add
4-1 #Subtract
2*3 #Multiply
5/2 #Divide
5**2 #Exponent
```
### The += Operator
This is a convenient way to modify a variable.
It takes the existing value in a variable
and adds to it.
You can also use any of the other
mathematical operators e.g. -= or *=
```
my_number = 4
my_number += 2
#result is 6
```
### The Modulo Operator
Often you'll want to know what is the
remainder after a division.
e.g. 4 รท 2 = 2 with no remainder
but 5 รท 2 = 2 with 1 remainder
The modulo does not give you the result
of the division, just the remainder.
It can be really helpful in certain situations,
e.g. figuring out if a number is odd or even.
```
5 % 2
#result is 1
```


## 4) E R R O R S
### Syntax Error
Syntax errors happen when your code
does not make any sense to the computer.
This can happen because you've misspelt
something or there's too many brackets or
a missing comma.
```
print(12 + 4))
File "<stdin>", line 1
print(12 + 4))
             ^
SyntaxError: unmatched ')'
```

### Name Error
This happens when there is a variable
with a name that the computer
does not recognise. It's usually because
you've misspelt the name of a variable
you created earlier.
Note: variable names are case sensitive!
```
my_number = 4
my_Number + 2
Traceback (most recent call
last): File "<stdin>", line 1,
NameError: name 'my_Number'
is not defined
```

### Zero Division Error
This happens when you try to divide by zero,
This is something that is mathematically
impossible so Python will also complain.
```
5 % 0
Traceback (most recent call
last): File "<stdin>", line 1,
ZeroDivisionError: integer
division or modulo by zero
```
