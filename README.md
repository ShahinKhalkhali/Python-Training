a floating point number.
```

### Strings
A string is just a string of characters.
It should be surrounded by double quotes.
```
my_string = "Hello"

### String Concatenation
You can add strings to string to create
a new string. This is called concatenation.
It results in a new string.
```
"Hello" + "Angela"

```
### Escaping a String
Because the double quote is special, it
denotes a string, if you want to use it in
a string, you need to escape it with a "\"
```
speech = "She said: \"Hi\""
print(speech)
#prints: She said: "Hi"
```
### F-Strings
You can insert a variable into a string
using f-strings.
The syntax is simple, just insert the variable
in-between a set of curly braces {}.
```
days = 365
